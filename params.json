  "body": "# What is it?\r\nHealthTranslator is a Chrome extension that helps you during your health related searches on the Web. It recognizes medical concepts in Web documents and provides you more information such as definitions, related concepts and external references for a deeper search.\r\n\r\n###Innovative Features\r\nHealthTranslator differs from the competitors by providing more and faster information. The medical concepts are recognized from vocabularies with thousands of records.\r\n\r\nThe community can also help by rating the results and suggesting new medical concepts to recognize. That data can be later used for tool improvements.\r\n\r\n###Supported Languages\r\nIt currently supports English and Portuguese. \r\n\r\nAs of our knowledge, it's the first tool providing Portuguese support.\r\n\r\n###Highly customizable\r\nThe extension's settings are very customizable. You just want it to recognize diseases? Sure, no problem! You can filter the recognized semantic types. \r\n\r\nOr maybe just translate Portuguese Web pages? Three clicks. Done.\r\n\r\nThere are many more options that you may want to explore to fullfil your taste. We want you happy and productive.\r\n\r\n###Printscreens\r\nSome printscreens here\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Team\r\nThis is an academical project, developed during the dissertation of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6798502/14848610/6f1d7c6a-0c66-11e6-8513-03bbd9cdba7c.png\" width=150/>\r\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6798502/14848668/b21cf090-0c66-11e6-9f34-7d3c7603e196.png\" width=150/>\r\n",
